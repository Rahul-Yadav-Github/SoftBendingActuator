# Usage Instructions

Follow these instructions to set up and use the Soft Bending Actuator project.

## Setup

1. Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram (Schematics/CircuitDiagram.png).
2. Upload the Arduino code (ArduinoCode/SoftBendingActuator.ino) to your Arduino board.
3. Ensure the power supply is correctly connected and turned on.

## Operation

- The Arduino will read the flex sensor value and map it to an angle.
- Based on the angle, the Arduino will control the solenoid valves to adjust the bending of the actuator.
- Monitor the Serial Monitor for real-time sensor values and angle readings.

## Safety

Ensure all connections are secure and the power supply ratings are appropriate for your components to avoid any damage.
