# Soft Bending Actuator Project

This project demonstrates the use of a soft bending actuator with proprioceptive curvature sensing using an Arduino, relay module, solenoid air valves, and a flex sensor.

## Objectives

- Control the soft bending actuator using solenoid air valves.
- Measure the curvature angle of the actuator using a flex sensor.
- Provide real-time feedback and control based on the curvature angle.

## Components

- Arduino (e.g., Uno)
- Soft bending actuator
- Flex sensor
- Relay module
- Solenoid air valves
- 12V power supply
- Resistors (e.g., 10k ohms for pull-down)
- Tubing and connectors for the pneumatic system
